George Githuma Njogu

Who:

I am a self taught software developer with proficiency in web technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJs, Python and React. I enjoy designing and building products and systems that help businesses and organizations easily interact with their customers, collect data efficiently and for e-commerce platforms make seamless payments.

More than web technologies, I am an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner with knowledge of hosting and migrating applications to the cloud. 

I have also recently developed an interest in native applications and I am working on my kotlin android skills.

What:

Demo sites to show off my ReactJs skills.
